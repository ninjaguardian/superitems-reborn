# **Ideas**

### mage sword

- Uses fangs

- Change step height attribute and reach

  

### More fun!

  

- There will be new types of items e.g. longsword (more range using attribute, less speed) dagger (more speed, less range) and utility stuff (more block place range) and more. There will also be craftable runes (only 1 of each category can be equipped at a time) that give buffs for certain actions: e.g. small period of full invis.

  

- Change leap to have 3 enchant levels.

    1. default launch

    2. gains the ability for double jump by pressing [F] 2 times in quick secession. There will also be a little box indicator with the leap logo inside slowly desaturation up to down after you press the first [F]. You must press [F] again in that time period and be in the air for it to activate.

    3. gains the ability for angled leaps instead of the default. (The default can still be activated by pressing [F] and shifting while the indicator is up). It will launch the player in the way they are already moving.

  

- There will be a /trigger command to show the player what each level of the item does. e.g. /trigger item_help and maybe use macros (if possible) or make a custom command to show a book with the info.

  

- The blacksmith at spawn allows crafting of runic powder and ingots. every session after the first will spawn an npc somewhere in the world that will tell you the recipe for the runic of that day. It will require a runic ingot, the base item, and whatever else to make it hard. The countdown until the item spawns then begins and cords are broadcasted.

  

### Good stuff

  

- Runics can't be enderchested

- Advancements?

- Use bossbar (try to hide texture) for more gui space

# **Issues**

### Minor

- When first getting a cooldown, when it uses add to get to the right value, it goes through all other Unicode characters

- creative and spectator are not immune to supers
