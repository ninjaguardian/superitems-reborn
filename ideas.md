# Ideas
### mage sword
- Uses fangs


# Item types
- It's on school device notes


# Minor issue
- When first getting a cooldown, when it uses add to get to the right value, it goes through all other unicode charecters
- creative and spectator are not immune to supers

# Runic ingots
- CustomModelData
- Steel with blue
- Use rescource pack to change name? somehow? SOLVED: /give @s sponge[item_name='{"text":"Cheese"}',custom_model_data=115]
